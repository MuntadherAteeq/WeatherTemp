This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# TODO :

- [x] create a search List with flags of each available countries.
- [ ] Add settings button beside search button to change (f/c , 12/24 , km/mi ).
- [ ] make the current location of the user is the default weather location.
- [ ] Delete Refresh Button.
- [ ] Make the background of the app as glass effect

## Note:

- From F to c (32°F − 32) × 5/9 = 0°C
- To convert kilometres per hour to miles per hour, multiply the speed in km/h by 0.621371. This factor is derived from the exact equivalence of one mile to 1.60934 kilometres. Using the formula that we have above, we can determine that 100 kph is equal to 62.14 mph.
